# 👋 Hey there!

I'm Sarthak — a Full Stack Web Developer who enjoys building real, working systems from scratch.

I don’t just design interfaces —  
I build logic, structure databases, handle authentication, optimize APIs, and make things actually function behind the scenes.

If I get an idea, I don’t just think about it…  
I architect it, build it, debug it, and ship it.

## 🛠 What I Like Building

- Full-stack web applications
- Backend-heavy systems
- Real-time features
- Authentication systems
- Projects that solve real-world problems

I build to understand — not just to finish.

## ⚡ Fun Facts

- 💻 I enjoy backend more than frontend  
- ☕︎ I like both coffee & tea
- 🌙 I sometimes code late into the night  
- 🧠 I like building things that challenge me
